My website is inspired by an IOS app called "How I feel". My website has a plethora of emotions and they have nice gradients and animations. When you click on any of the emotions, it scrolls smoothly to the emotions page where you can describe why you are feeling that way and once you hit submit you automatically scroll back up. I made it because I believe that any type of emotion is worth venting out!
